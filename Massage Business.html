	<h2><font face='Calibri' color='green'>Education</font><h2>
			<p> Dr. Sergey Komarov from Tambov, Russian Federation. He studied for 12 years in Military Medical Academy and completed the necessary residency
				hours to qualify him for the title of 'Doctor.' He then worked in St. Petersburg, Russia as a general physician for five years, before deciding
				to permanently move to the United States of America. Here, Dr. Komarov studied the art of massage therapy. After studying and practicing at the European School of Massage therapy, 
				over the course of two years, he obtained his license in 2004. Though he is not presently a doctor in the U.S., there is a wise 
				Russian saying: "There are no former doctors."
  			 </p>

<h2><font face='Calibri' color='green'>Experience</font><h2>
			<p> This idea of there not being any former doctors holds true here at Sergey's massage studio. For over 14 years, every treatment conducted
				by Dr. Sergey Komarov has had one thing in mind: "How can I cure my patients?" With this mentality, treatments are customized to meet 
				individual health conditions, constantly searching for new areas of pain and seeking to relieve them. Because you do not have to be
				dealing with pain. Schedule an appointment with Dr. Sergey Komarov today, and show pain who's boss. <br/>
